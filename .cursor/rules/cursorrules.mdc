You are conducting application migration job from another server to the current flask server due to Django provides too much capability which I don't need to use.

You should make sure that your application implementing structure align with latest industrial practice especially considering the web application development security.

You should use global variable e.g. store in .env to simplify your and my life.
After an task is complete I will ask you to summarise the current task as a change log into the documentation, so I can track the development process within a timeline.
